# Reporting Players and Appealing 
Here at Timolia, we do not want to enforce rules which seem to be too narrow-minded to us. We allow provocations such as 'eZ'. Therefore, your time on Timolia will be less filtered than you maybe are used to. 
Anyhow, every player has to obey our rules. Unfortunately, rule violations do happen sometimes but you can and should report them.

 
### The Report system 
With a few commands, you can report a player once they violate our rules. In case they are hacking, teaming or bugusing, you can create a so-called <strong>live report</strong>. 
For players who cannot behave well in chat or who advertise, you can create a <strong>chat report</strong> which saves all public messages of the defendant. 
Please note that private messages, party messages and friend broadcasts are not logged by our systems to protect your privacy. 
You can report this kind of message with a screenshot or video of the complete Minecraft window on tour https://i.imgur.com/5LWmybt.png or in-game via `/reportevidence <username> <evidence>`.

### Reporting players on our Discord 
In case a player who violated our rules went offline before a team member could spectate them, you can report the player on our [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord) with video evidence. 
Please note that we cannot accept any video evidence regarding hacking reports to prevent abuse. 
To verify your Discord account on our Discord, you can run `/register <email>` in-game. 
You have to attach any sort of evidence to your post. Usually, videos are the only accepted evidence for reports. However, players who violated our rules in chat (only private messages, party messages and friend broadcasts) may be reported with a screenshot of the whole Minecraft window. Of course, you can also use `/report` in-game. 

 
### Appeals 
You can apologise for a ban or mute at any time - regardless of how long the ban lasts or how many times you have already been banned.
You can submit an apology in the [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord) via a support ticket or alternatively by direct message here <a href="https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=385909409" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>.
Please note: The more often you have been banned or muted in the last year, the lower the chance that your apology will lead to a shortening of your ban period or a complete banishment.
 
### Prescription of bans 
For any rule violation, you will be banned for a <strong>maximum of 30 days</strong>. After that, you can play on Timolia again. 
However, the ban days are kept and when breaking the rules again, the newly received ban days will be added upon the old ban days.

Since people chance, realize their mistakes and get better, we introduced the <strong>prescription</strong> of bans. 
It ensures that the ban days are not kept forever but instead degrades over time. Once you reach 30 ban days or less, you can play on Timolia again. 
The prescription starts <strong>6 months</strong> after the start of the ban. From then on, every month <strong>3 days</strong> will be deducted. 
Therefore, when having been banned for 30 days, after 7 months 27 ban days are left, after 8 months 24 days and after 16 months the ban is fully decayed.
