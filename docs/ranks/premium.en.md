# Premium ranks
Since Timolia is financed entirely by the community, we are grateful for every donation from you. 
As you should not spend your money on a Minecraft server for no reason at all, you will get a special rank on our network in return! 
The ranks are available in our shop which you can reach at [https://www.timolia.de/shop](https://www.timolia.de/shop).

## Sponsor-Ranks
The sponsor ranks symbolize our gratitude towards players, which especially financially
support Timolia.
These ranks cannot be purchased in the shop, but are assigned manually from a certain amount (see table).

|                             | <span>Sponsor: (Level 1)</span> | <span>Sponsor: (Level 2)</span> | <span>Sponsor: (Level 3)</span> |

**Important: Purchases made before May 31, 2022 are not included in this rule!**

## How do I get this rank?

If you have qualified for a sponsor rank, register on our Discord ([Link](https://timolia.de/discord)) in the #support channel or send an email to info@timolia.de (corresponding proof of purchase must be present!)

## Gift cards and Pixelboosters
Besides the premium ranks you can also get [gift cards](https://shop.timolia.de/#Gifts) and [Pixelboosters](https://shop.timolia.de/#Pixel) in our shop.

With our **gift cards**, all ranks and pixel boosters available in the shop can be purchased. They can also be freely combined with other vouchers and payment methods 
and can be used in our Buycraft system over several payment transactions, should they not be fully used in the first payment.
The purchased gift cards will be sent by email and can be handed over digitally or freshly printed.    

With **Pixelboosters** you not only multiply the number of pixels you earn yourself, but also those of your friends and fellow players in joint rounds. 
Once purchased, you can activate the Pixelbooster ingame in the Pixelshop under your items. 
Duration and strength depend on which booster you chose during the purchase - but with the given choice there is certainly something for everyone!
Now the question remains, what happens if you already have a rank on Timolia: Very simple! 
In addition to the Pixel you receive due to your rank, you'll get the Pixel of the booster added on top, so you can earn more pixels than ever before.

## The payment methods
You can support Timolia with a donation either by Buycraft (PayPal, bank transfer).
Payments via Buycraft are processed directly on the server.

Click [<strong>here</strong>](https://shop.timolia.de)/ to donate via Buycraft (shop.timolia.de).

## I did not receive my rank, what can I do?
Payments can take a while. 
If your rank is still not there 24 hours after placing your order, please contact us in out support channel. 
After providing a few details about your purchase, the order will be processed by a responsible team member. 
Since this process must be done manually, it may also take a few hours. 

## Do I keep my rank after a name change?
Since not only the name but also the UUID is saved when you make a donation, your rank will be preserved even after a name change.
Please always enter your current name to avoid complications!

## Can I transfer my rank?
No, all ranks are bound to the account and cannot be transferred. 
If you made a mistake while placing an order, please report it as soon as possible, otherwise another account may keep your rank.

## How do Premium Features behave after my rank expires?
When your rank expires, features exclusive to premium players will no longer be actively accessible, but they are not lost – only inactive. Once you regain a premium rank, you can use them again.

Here are some examples:
- In JumpWorld, the additional entities you placed due to your rank will not be deleted after the rank expires. They remain on the map but cannot be re-placed after removal.
- If you used additional building slots, you won't be able to access or publish the map without the rank. However, once you regain the rank, you can seamlessly continue building.
- Kits created in 1vs1 are saved but become inaccessible after the rank expires.
- Pixelshop features are deactivated after the rank expires but are still available. They become accessible again when you regain the rank.
- Monthly MegaPixels remain intact and can be spent even without an active rank.

## Will my rank be refunded??
Money that was paid for a rank is usually not refunded by us.
