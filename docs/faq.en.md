When you got any questions, we do not only love to support in-game but also both on our TeamSpeak and Discord server.
We are always happy when someone approaches us and hopefully, we can help you with your problems or comments.
You can also contact us on the social media platform Twitter where our social media team supports you all around the clock. 
Additionally, you can report in-game problems, bugs and any comments via our ticket system. 
You can do this by entering the command `/ticket <issue>`.

### How does the kick system work?
We have a very complex and unique kick system to give both premium and normal players a great gaming experience 
without waiting forever. Each player receives an individual "kick value" when joining the network, based on the 
in-game rank. The higher the rank, the higher the "kick value". A player with a higher kick value kicks the player 
with the lowest kick value if a server is full.

| Rank | Kick value |
| ------ | -------- |
| User | 0 |
| <span class='pro'>Pro</span> | 300 |
| <span class='pro'>Pro+</span> | 400 |
| <span class='mvp'>MVP</span> | 500 |
| <span class='mvp'>MVP+</span> | 600 |
| <span class='expert'>Expert</span> | 800 |
| <span class='youtuber'>Youtuber</span> | 900 |

When e.g. an Expert joins a full server, a random player with the lowest KV is sent back to 
one of the game lobbies. Their kick value automatically increases by 1. Thus, the next time it is more likely that 
they will not be kicked because the other players now have a lower kick value. As soon as a game starts, each player 
is assigned their standard kick value again.

to mention the builders if you should use a Timolia map.
