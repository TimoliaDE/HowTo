### How does the kick system work?
We have a very complex and unique kick system to give both premium and normal players a great gaming experience 
without waiting forever. Each player receives an individual "kick value" when joining the network, based on the 
in-game rank. The higher the rank, the higher the "kick value". A player with a higher kick value kicks the player 
with the lowest kick value if a server is full.

| Rank                                   | Kick value  |
|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| User                                    | 0          |
| <span class='pro'>Pro</span>            | 300        |
| <span class='pro'>Pro+</span>           | 400        |
| <span class='pro'>Subscriber</span>     | 400        |
| <span class='mvp'>MVP</span>            | 500        |
| <span class='mvp'>MVP+</span>           | 600        |
| <span class='mvp'>Subscriber+</span>    | 600        |
| <span class='expert'>Expert</span>      | 800        |
| <span class='expert'>Subscriber*</span> | 900        |
| <span class='youtuber'>Youtuber</span>  | 900        |

When e.g. an Expert joins a full server, a random player with the lowest KV is sent back to 
one of the game lobbies. Their kick value automatically increases by 1. Thus, the next time it is more likely that 
they will not be kicked because the other players now have a lower kick value. As soon as a game starts, each player 
is assigned their standard kick value again.

### Where can I appeal?
If you have been banned for at least 10 days, your ban can be shortened by up to 1/3 of your ban time, if your excuse is well 
written. You can post your appeal on our [Discord](https://timolia.e/discord), alternatively 
you can also send us a DM <a href="https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=385909409" target="_blank">here</a> 
on Twitter. Caution! If you have been banned twice for hacking or have more than 46 ban days, you first have to wait 
until your ban days have expired to 46 days or less. Furthermore, you can only apologize if you have not already 
apologized 3 times in the last 6 months, nor if a ban has already been lifted in that time period. 
You can verify your discord account via the Minecraft server `register.timolia.de` if you have not already done so.

You can submit your maps on our discord channel [#ideas](https://discord.com/channels/407554118887014402/1047084675627221092). All maps are examined by 
team members, especially by our builder team.

### May I use maps from Timolia?
We do not offer any maps that you can find on our network as a download, as it is not welcomed to distribute our 
maps without prior consent. However, we will not take any action against the use of our maps, so we ask you
to mention the builders if you should use a Timolia map.
