Here you can find out more about whether and how you can apply in the area of Administration, System-Administration, Development, Moderation, Support, Building or Content.

### Administration, System-Administration and Moderation 
These ranks are only given to active team members. External persons cannot apply for these ranks. 
They take great responsibility in organizational and administrative areas and their positions require intensive knowledge of Timolia's internal structure.


### Developer
With an email to <a href="mailto:development@timolia.de">development@timolia.de</a> you can apply as a developer at any time.
Detailed knowledge of Java and the Spigot API, experience in using Git, ability to work in a team, basic knowledge of the English language and a minimum age of 14 year are required.
Your application should contain your in-game name, a short description of yourself, a description of your skills and competences and contact information. 
We also ask you to give us access to sample code you have programmed. Ideally, this should be hosted on GitLab, GitHub, or a similar platform, as we do not accept sample code as a file.
We are especially interested in clean, well-commented code that reflects your skills. You should also make sure you follow the Java conventions.
  
As a <b>Developer+</b> you have many years of experience as a developer on Timolia and are available to answer internal questions about development. Therefore, applications for this rank are not possible.


### Supporter
If we look for new team members in the area of support, we check which players are the most active on the network while standing out positively.
By the latter we mean, among other things, to have good report statistics, not seriously having violated our rules and being activity on other platforms, as on the forums, TeamSpeak and Discord (possibly also on Twitter).

In addition to that, there is the possibility to send an unsolicited application, which should include your in-game name, an introduction of yourself and descriptions of your previous experiences, by 
email to <a href="mailto:supporter@timolia.de">supporter@timolia.de</a>. We try to complete the application process as soon as possible. However, please note that this process may take more than a month.
Please also note that you must be at least 14 years old to submit a unsolicited application and join the Timolia team.

Since the <b>Supporter+</b> rank represents a promotion for very experienced supporters, applications for this rank are not possible.
