## §1 – General
In the following, the rules for the Minecraft server network Timolia.de are listed. By using a service provided by Timolia every user accepts all
points of the rules and must follow them. Disregard can lead to penalties, up to exclusion from the Timolia network and all related sites and services.

Furthermore, the rules can be changed at any time. Therefore the date of the last change is always shown under the last point of the rules.

## §2 – Modifications (Mods)/Hacks, Resource Packs and Minimaps
Any modifications in and to the game are prohibited on Timolia. This includes basically all mods, but also certain types of beneficial resource packs, 
especially transparent or Xray resource packs. Moreover, macros and other modifications to the Minecraft client, mouse and keyboard, which allow spamming of 
keys/commands and chat messages or even increasing the click speed, are prohibited. This also includes MouseTweaks and the use of programmable keyboards, mice 
or hotkeys for the above purposes. Skinblinkers and all types of minimaps are also prohibited. 
In general, you can assume that any game-relevant, advantageous changes are forbidden. 
This includes, for example, using the mouse wheel as an alternative to a mouse button.

Excluded from this rule are game-enhancing mods like [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/) or [Shaders](https://www.google.de/#q=Minecraft+Shader) 
as well as the [50](https://5zig.net/)- and [LabyMod](https://www.labymod.net/). A detailed list of all allowed mods can be found [here](/rules/approvedmods/). 
If you want to play with a mod that is not on this list, we recommend you to contact the [Timolia support](/faq/#who-supported-me-if-I-have-questions).
The list is updated regularly. Mods that offer similar features as the mods listed there, but are not on the list, have not been reviewed by us and may lead to a ban.
We, therefore, advise against using these mods without having asked in advance.

## §3 – Cheating/Bugusing
Bugusing is the intentional exploitation of game errors that have consequences that are not foreseen in the game and is of course forbidden.
Instead, it is desired to report these bugs to the team on the [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord) or in-game.
This prohibition also refers to the exploitation of bugs in otherwise [allowed modifications](/rules/approvedmods/).

## §4 – Behavior in the chat and in-game
The Timolia team expects fair and respectful behavior from every player.

### Paragraph 1 – Insults
All insults are prohibited. Bypassing the chat filter with spaces, punctuation marks or similar is also prohibited.

- <u>Discrimination</u>: Exclusion, insulting and agitating against other nationalities, ethnic groups, religions, sexualities, minorities or other groups is prohibited on Timolia and will be banned without warning.
- <u>National Socialism</u>: National Socialist statements, slogans and similar are forbidden on Timolia and will be banned without warning.

### Paragraph 2 – Advertising and phishing/fraud
- <u>Self-promotion</u>: Self-promotion on the Discord Server is allowed, provided that it is not intrusively placed or spammed.
In the 1v1 kit advertising for your own YouTube channel or Twitter account is allowed.
- <u>Server advertising</u>: Server advertising is prohibited. Even sending a server address once can and will be considered as advertising and sanctioned accordingly.
Sending an IP or server address via the private chat is allowed as long as you do not harass anyone or actively advertise.
- <u>Phishing and fraud</u>: To prevent phishing and fraud, private trading on the server is prohibited in any form.
This includes the alleged sale of Minecraft accounts, free offers, e.g. of Optifine capes and similar. 
Skimming off user data such as passwords and e-mails of other users by false promises is a criminal offense and will be reported to the police. 
Also, permanent exclusion from the Timolia network takes place. This also includes a pure attempt.
- <u>Tournament advertising in 1vs1</u>: Advertising for a tournament by any kind of winnings of material value is prohibited. This includes promising Paysafecards or Minecraft accounts when you win a tournament.

### Paragraph 3 – Skins and usernames
Offensive, insulting, racist or national socialist skins and usernames are prohibited. This includes, for example, nude skins, Hitler skins and also capes with corresponding symbols.
Timolia also reserves the right to block skins, capes and the like which, in our view, convey morally incompatible values, even if they do not explicitly fall under the above categories.

## §5 – Pretending using hacks & faking reports
The intentional misleading of team members is prohibited. Penalties arising from this will not be lifted.
It is also forbidden to use fake reports to accuse players of a rule violation that they have not committed. Furthermore, any form of exploitation of the report system is prohibited.

## §6 – Statsboosting
Boosting your stats in all kinds of game modes by using unfair game methods is not allowed on Timolia. This includes, but is not limited to, kits that give you a significant advantage over your opponent by having the same or similar items.

## §7 – 1v1
### Paragraph 1 - ranked system and Friday Tournament

Apologies and weighting:

Every player has the opportunity to apologise at any time for a violation of the ranked rules. The more often you have been punished for such offences in the past, 
the lower the chance that your apology will lead to a shortening of the ban period or a complete banishment.

Rules:

- <u>VPN</u>: (violation results in ranked ban from current season + elo reset) Playing on a VPN or disguising your IP otherwise is prohibited.

- <u>Accountsharing</u>: (violation results in ranked ban from current season + elo reset) Playing in the ranked queue is only permitted on your own account.

- <u>Multiaccounting</u>: (violation results in ranked ban from current season + elo reset) Playing with multiple accounts is prohibited.

- <u>Elo manipulation</u>: (violation results in 5 days ranked ban + match invalidation) Manipulating elo, such as intentionally losing, asking for surrender, etc. is prohibited.

- <u>Camping & kiting</u>: (violation results in warning + match invalidation) Camping, such as towering in a corner, is prohibited. Healing full or unnecessarily delaying a fight by running, placing water buckets, etc. (kiting), is prohibited.

### Paragraph 2 – Kits
Inappropriate kits are all 1v1 kits that, in Timolia's opinion, disrupt a fair or enjoyable gaming experience. These include, among others:

- <u>Crash kits</u>: Kits that cause a player's Minecraft client to freeze, crash or prevent participation in the game.

- <u>Cosmetic kits</u>: Kits created with a modified client that include changes that are not possible with an unmodified Minecraft client - for example, altered effects, item properties, or heart counts.

- <u>Provocative or trolling kits</u>: Such as offensive naming, symbolic provocation or deliberately unplayable kit designs.

- <u>Hacker kits</u>: Kits intentionally designed to take unfair advantage.

All kits of this type are banned on Timolia. They will be deleted by us. Repeated creation or use of such kits may be penalised with a ban.

## §8 – JumpWorld
The general Timolia rules also apply to created worlds in JumpWorld. Thus, any kind of racist, offensive or insulting buildings, world names or phrases on signs are prohibited.

## §9 – 4rena
- <u>Teaming</u>: Teams are forbidden in 4rena FFA. In 4rena 2v2 crossteaming is forbidden.
  If a team is warned by a supporter and continues to crossteam, all team members will be kicked or banned.

## §10 – Timolianische Spiele
The unnecessary delay of the game is not desired. This explicitly includes actions like building a house, animal farming and hunting the ender dragon. Teams of any size are allowed.

## §11 – InTime
- <u>Teaming</u>: In the game mode InTime teams of any size are prohibited.
- <u>Time stealing</u>: Letting time be stolen is defined by letting another player intentionally steal the time from you with the clock so they end up having more time.
If this is detected, the player who intentionally let the time be stolen and the player who stole the time will be kicked and the incident will be noted. 
If this happens repeatedly, the player may also be banned.

## §12 – Castles
Teaming beyond the team sizes (so-called cross-teaming) is prohibited. Intentionally hindering your own team members in the form of gold theft, destroying your own 
structures, untactical spawn trapping and any other methods that prevent the normal flow of the game is also prohibited and will be punished accordingly. 
Spawn trapping is considered untactical if you cannot pick up the flag in the base of the spawn trapped opponents or if you kill the players longer than necessary to steal the flag.

## §13 – Mineception
Teaming beyond the team sizes (so-called cross-teaming) is prohibited. Intentionally obstructing your own team members in the form of blocks that are removed from under 
them (so-called spleefing), stealing items and intentionally not releasing them from prison or other possible methods that hinder the normal flow of the game is also prohibited and will be punished accordingly.

## §14 – Conquer
Teaming beyond the team sizes (so-called cross-teaming) is prohibited. Intentionally hindering your own team members is also not allowed in any form and will be punished accordingly.

## §15 - UHC
In UHC there are several rules that are displayed at the beginning of each round. These are:

- Stripmining and the like is allowed
- Spamming chunkreloads is forbidden
- Towering is forbidden from the 50x50 border onwards
- Griefing and excessive tracking during farm time is forbidden
- Teaming or crossteaming is allowed, unless otherwise announced in the current UHC
- Bugusing is forbidden
- Camping is forbidden from the 100x100 border onwards

## §16 – Unbans, ban shortening and bypassing the ban
- <u>Permanent bans</u>: In general all bans are temporary. However, if you exceed a ban time of 30 days in total, you will automatically be banned permanently.
- <u>Unbans</u>: If a player has the opinion that a ban is not justified, he can demand proof at any time by creating a supportticket on our [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord). 
  If you are permanently banned, you can make a request for an unban on our [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord). Here you should make a special effort because it is very difficult to be unbanned after a permanent ban.
- <u>Ban shortening</u>: From a period of at least 10 days each user has the right to make a request on our [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord) for ban shortening.
  If you exceed 46 ban days, you must wait until your ban days have expired to 46 days or less.
  Please also note that you can only write an appeal in case you have not apologized 3 times during the past 6 months, nor have you already been unbanned in that time period.
  If you don't have an verified Discord account, you can verify for it on the Minecraft server `register.timolia.de`. 
  Alternatively you can send us a DM <a href="https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=385909409" target="_blank">here</a> on Twitter with your apology.
- Bypassing bans with a second account is prohibited on timolia. 
  The account, the person using the account and the address used at that time are considered banned. 
  Accounts that are used to bypass a ban will be permanently banned from the Timolia network without ban expiration and will only be unbanned upon request and activation of [Two-factor authentication](/2fa). 
  Passing on account data incl. 2fa codes or secrets of an account that was already permanently banned for bypassing a ban without ban expiry will result in a new permanent ban without ban expiry from the Timolia network, but without the possibility of another unban.
  In case of repeated violations of the bans, all affected accounts can be permanently banned from Timolia without any chance of being banned. 
  The ban days of the original account will be transferred to all secondary accounts.

## §17 – Refund for technical errors
- Should pixels or points be reset due to technical errors (server crashes, etc.), the team's usual behavior is not to refund them.
- Should you notice any violations of the rules, it is desired to always report them with proof on our [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord) or in-game to a team member.


<strong>The team reserves the right to sanction certain actions that are not explicitly listed in the rules.</strong>
