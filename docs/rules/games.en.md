## §1 – General
In the following, the rules for the Minecraft server network Timolia.de are listed. By using a service provided by Timolia every user accepts all
points of the rules and must follow them. Disregard can lead to penalties, up to exclusion from the Timolia network and all related sites and services.

Furthermore, the rules can be changed at any time. Therefore the date of the last change is always shown under the last point of the rules.

## §2 – Modifications (Mods)/Hacks, Resource Packs and Minimaps
Any modifications in and to the game are prohibited on Timolia. This includes basically all mods, but also certain types of beneficial resource packs, 
especially transparent or Xray resource packs. Moreover, macros and other modifications to the Minecraft client, mouse and keyboard, which allow spamming of 
keys/commands and chat messages or even increasing the click speed, are prohibited. This also includes MouseTweaks and the use of programmable keyboards, mice 
or hotkeys for the above purposes. Skinblinkers and all types of minimaps are also prohibited. 
In general, you can assume that any game-relevant, advantageous changes are forbidden. 
This includes, for example, using the mouse wheel as an alternative to a mouse button.

Excluded from this rule are game-enhancing mods like [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/) or [Shaders](https://www.google.de/#q=Minecraft+Shader) 
as well as the [50](https://5zig.net/)- and [LabyMod](https://www.labymod.net/). A detailed list of all allowed mods can be found [here](/rules/approvedmods/). 
If you want to play with a mod that is not on this list, we recommend you to contact the [Timolia support](/faq/#who-supported-me-if-I-have-questions).
The list is updated regularly. Mods that offer similar features as the mods listed there, but are not on the list, have not been reviewed by us and may lead to a ban.
We, therefore, advise against using these mods without having asked in advance.

## §3 – Cheating/Bugusing
Bugusing is the intentional exploitation of game errors that have consequences that are not foreseen in the game and is of course forbidden.
Instead, it is desired to report these bugs to the team on the [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord) or in-game.
This prohibition also refers to the exploitation of bugs in otherwise [allowed modifications](/rules/approvedmods/).

## §4 – Behavior in the chat and in-game
The Timolia team expects fair and respectful behavior from every player.

## §11 – InTime

structures, untactical spawn trapping and any other methods that prevent the normal flow of the game is also prohibited and will be punished accordingly.

## §13 – Mineception
Teaming beyond the team sizes (so-called cross-teaming) is prohibited. Intentionally obstructing your own team members in the form of blocks that are removed from under 
them (so-called spleefing), stealing items and intentionally not releasing them from prison or other possible methods that hinder the normal flow of the game is also prohibited and will be punished accordingly.

## §16 – Unbans, ban shortening and bypassing the ban
- <u>Permanent bans</u>: In general all bans are temporary. However, if you exceed a ban time of 30 days in total, you will automatically be banned permanently.
- <u>Unbans</u>: If a player has the opinion that a ban is not justified, he can demand proof at any time by creating a supportticket on our [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord). 
  If you are permanently banned, you can make a request for an unban on our [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord). Here you should make a special effort because it is very difficult to be unbanned after a permanent ban.
- <u>Ban shortening</u>: From a period of at least 10 days each user has the right to make a request on our [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord) for ban shortening.
  If you exceed 46 ban days, you must wait until your ban days have expired to 46 days or less.
  Please also note that you can only write an appeal in case you have not apologized 3 times during the past 6 months, nor have you already been unbanned in that time period.
  If you don't have an verified Discord account, you can verify for it on the Minecraft server `register.timolia.de`. 
  Alternatively you can send us a DM <a href="https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=385909409" target="_blank">here</a> on Twitter with your apology.
- Bypassing bans with a second account is prohibited on timolia. 
  The account, the person using the account and the address used at that time are considered banned. 
  Accounts that are used to bypass a ban will be permanently banned from the Timolia network without ban expiration and will only be unbanned upon request and activation of [Two-factor authentication](/2fa). 
  Passing on account data incl. 2fa codes or secrets of an account that was already permanently banned for bypassing a ban without ban expiry will result in a new permanent ban without ban expiry from the Timolia network, but without the possibility of another unban.
  In case of repeated violations of the bans, all affected accounts can be permanently banned from Timolia without any chance of being banned. 
  The ban days of the original account will be transferred to all secondary accounts.

## §17 – Refund for technical errors
- Should pixels or points be reset due to technical errors (server crashes, etc.), the team's usual behavior is not to refund them.
- Should you notice any violations of the rules, it is desired to always report them with proof on our [Discord](https://timolia.de/discord) or in-game to a team member.


<strong>The team reserves the right to sanction certain actions that are not explicitly listed in the rules.</strong>
