## The basic idea
JumpWorld is your creative playground to create own Jump 'n' Runs or play cool parcours made by the community!

## How to play
- The rocket in your hotbar opens the search menu. Explore the thousands and thousands of Jump 'n' Runs already created!
- You know what you want? With `/enter <ID>` you can enter a Jump 'n' Run as long as you know it's ID.
- Use `/duel invite <Spieler>` or hit them with your sword to invite players into a duel!
- The Jump 'n' Run of the day can be reached through the big nether portal near the spawn.
- Each Jump 'n' Run contains a golden pressure plate marking the finish of the map. Iron pressure plates are checkpoints.
- While in a Jump 'n' Run you have some useful items in your hotbar:
- The red dye resets you. You start again from the last checkpoint.
- The second item in your hotbar allows you to toggle the visibility of other players in the Jump 'n' Run.
- After finishing a Jump 'n' Run you can rate in in three categories: Creativity, Jumps and Looks.
- Wanna explore the Jump 'n' Run without bothering with difficult jumps? Use `/spec` to activate fly mode. You will not be able to finish a Jump 'n' Run in spectator mode.

## The Jump 'n' Run of the day
At midnight, the parcour of the day is announced.
To become Jump 'n' Run of the day a parcour needs to:

- be published between 8 pm on day X-4 and 8 pm on day X-1
- have a finish rate of 10% or higher considering all players who tried to finish it.
- have at least 15 ratings
- have a better raiting than any other parcour meeting these criterias

## Build mode
- The firework star in your hotbar shows you your building slots. Premium ranks can have up to three building slots!
- If you want to build with friends invite them into a duel before entering the map you want to work on.
- When getting started you can choose between a void map and different presets to build your map on!
- The command `/b` gives you access to special blocks. Portals and pressure plates can be edited via right click.
- `/setstart` defines the start of your Jump 'n' Run, `/setblock` sets a block right below you. Very handy for void maps.
- To publish your map it needs to have been completed at least once by yourself. Choose the option "Test Jump 'n' Run" in the building slot menu!
- The building slots menu also contains an option to rename your Jump 'n' Run.
- You can place up to 500.000 blocks in a Jump 'n' Run.

## Premium-Features
- With a premium rank players receive up to three times the normal amount of pixels.
- Depending on the rank players can use up to three building slots.
- <span class='mvp'>MVP</span> or higher: Armorstands und player heads in buildmode.
- <span class='pro'>Pro</span> or higher: Place up to 3 blocks at a time with multibuild.
- <span class='mvp'>MVP+</span> or higher: Place up to 6 blocks at a time with multibuild.
- Depending on the rank players can use up to 128 entities.
- Use `/togglerank` to go undercover and look like a normal user.
