## The basic idea
Castles is a tactical game in which your objective is to conquer the flags of your enemies. Depending on the gamemode, teams can consist of a maximum of one to four player who start the game in their own castle before proceeding to sprint or ride into the battleground, which consists of small floating islands connected by rickety bridges!

## How to play
- Use `/vote <Map>` or the options displayed in the chat to vote for your preferred map. 
- The objective of the game is to steal your enemies flags, bring them back into your own base and kill all the enemies afterwards.
- The enderchest in your base and the chests on the small islands all around your base provide you with gold to upgrade your castle, your shops and bridges.
- Different shops provide you with different gear to defeat your enemies.
- As long as a flag stands within your castle your team can always respawn. 
- Should your opponents manage to steal your flag you will no longer respawn. If you die, you can only be respawned when an ally steals a flag from them and brings it back into your base.
- If a team owns the majority of flags a timer starts counting down until the team wins through their flag power. 
- The game ends when all enemies are dead and can't respawn anymore.

- Each kill counts as two points (kills * 2).
- The conquering of a flag counts as eight points. (Conquests * 8).
- Winning the game doubles your points. (*2)
- Having the most kills of the game gives you +15 points.
- Having the second most kills of the game gives you +10 points.
- Having the third most kills of the game gives you +5 points.
- Redistributin 60% of the collected gold into structures gives you +12 points.
